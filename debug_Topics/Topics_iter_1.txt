Below is a “menu of upgrades” you can cherry-pick from.  Nothing here changes your public API, so existing screens still compile, but every item deepens either the teaching value or the quiz engine’s replay-ability.

───────────────── 1.  Broaden the Curriculum ─────────────────
Add the most requested Swift/iOS subjects that are currently missing.

Swift Core
• optionalsDeepDive                    – Optional chaining, nil-coalescing, implicitly unwrapped
• associatedTypes                      – Protocols with associated types, “some vs any”
• keyPaths                             – WritableKeyPath, ReferenceWritableKeyPath
• regularExpressions                   – Regex literals / first-class capture lists
• unicodeScalars                       – Character vs UnicodeScalar, extended grapheme clusters

Concurrency & Reactive
• structuredConcurrencyPatterns        – Cancellation, child-task hierarchy, priority
• sendable                             – @Sendable closures, Sendable conformance

Core iOS frameworks
• coreData                             – NSPersistentContainer, fetch requests, lightweight migration
• coreAnimation                        – CALayer hierarchy, implicit vs explicit animations
• accessibility                        – VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, semantic UI
• pushNotifications                    – UNUserNotificationCenter, APNs device token flow
• networking                           – URLSession, async/await, background transfers
• persistence                          – Codable + FileManager, Keychain, NSUserDefaults

Testing & CI
• uiTesting                            – XCUIApplication, recording, predicates
• performanceTesting                   – measure(metrics:), XCTClockMetric
• mocking                              – protocol‐based mocks, async sequences in tests
• continuousDelivery                   – Fastlane, notarization, TestFlight groups

Tooling
• instrumentsLeaks                     – Leaks template, cycle detection
• shaderDebugger                       – Metal frame capture, GPU counters
• accessibilityInspector               – Audit issues, color contrast
• profilerSwiftSyntax                  – `swift syntax` CLI, symbol graphs

───────────────── 2.  Layered Difficulty & Bloom’s Taxonomy ─────────────────
Add metadata so a topic can be served at multiple cognitive levels.

enum Difficulty: String, CaseIterable { case recall, apply, synthesize }

struct DiscreteMathQuestion { … let difficulty: Difficulty }

• Upgrade the generators by supplying easy (keyword), medium (snippet gap-fill), and hard (reason-about-bug) flavours.  
• In QuizFactory.generate(count:for:) accept a target difficulty distribution; beginners get mostly “recall”, advanced users see more “synthesize”.

───────────────── 3.  Richer Question Types ─────────────────
1. Code-order shuffle  
   – Present 4 code lines and ask the learner to drag them into the correct order.  
2. Hot spot  
   – Show a snippet and ask which line will crash/compile-fail.  
3. “Explain this output”  
   – Display a tiny program and ask for the printed result (great for optionals, value vs reference, capture lists).  
4. True/False lightning round  
   – Extremely fast review mode that uses the same engine but two buttons; turn on when `count` > 30.

Represent them with:

enum QuizQuestion {  
    case multiple(…)  
    case submit(…)  
    case reorder(ReorderQuestion)  
    case hotspot(HotSpotQuestion)  
    case tf(TrueFalseQuestion)  
}

Each new case conforms to Identifiable exactly as your existing enum does, so the UI needs only another switch arm in the row view.

───────────────── 4.  Spaced-Repetition Scoring ─────────────────
Persist per-Topic “ease” and “nextReviewDate” with Codable + AppStorage (or a tiny CoreData model).  
• After the user answers, compute a SM-2 score and reschedule that card.  
• QuizFactory.generate() then first pulls any due cards before filling the remainder with fresh ones.

───────────────── 5.  Inline Playground-Ready Examples ─────────────────
Add an “example” string (Markdown + runnable snippet) next to every explanation:

extension Topic { var example: String }

Example for optionalsDeepDive:
"""
var pet: String? = "Turtle"      // Optional String
print(pet?.count ?? 0)           // safely unwraps => 6
"""

Surface it in a collapsible disclosure group under each explanation view and add a “Copy to Playground” button.

───────────────── 6.  Micro-Achievements & Progress Charts ─────────────────
• Track streaks, fastest perfect round, topics mastered (= 3 consecutive correct answers at synthesize level).  
• Render with Swift Charts: Topic vs mastery % stacked bar.

───────────────── 7.  Lint & Localization Readiness ─────────────────
• Mark every user-visible string with NSLocalizedString so the same enum powers other languages.  
• Run SwiftLint’s “missing_docs” and “cyclomatic_complexity” rules to keep question generators under control.

───────────────── 8.  Example Code Snippet (New Topic + Question) ─────────────────
1. Add to Topic enum:
case keyPaths

2. Explanation map:
.keyPaths : "**Key paths** (`\\Type.property`) provide type-safe property references usable for KVO, binding, Combine, and sorting."

3. Generator:

static func keyPathsQuestion() -> DiscreteMathQuestion {
    make(
      "Which expression creates a WritableKeyPath from `Person` to `String`?",
      ["\\Person.name", "Person.name", "#keyPath(Person.name)", "\\Person.self.name"],
      0,
      "`\\Person.name` is a compile-time checked WritableKeyPath<Person,String>.",
      .keyPaths)
}

Hook it up in the dispatcher and you’re done.

───────────────── 9.  Safety Nets ─────────────────
• Add unit tests that iterate over every Topic and assert `generated().answers.indices` contains `correctAnswerIndex`.  
• Assert explanations & titles are non-empty to prevent UI placeholders.

───────────────── 10.  Roadmap Snapshot ─────────────────
Phase 1 (quick wins): new topics + explanation examples (1,8,9)  
Phase 2 (engagement): richer question types & difficulty (2,3)  
Phase 3 (retention): spaced repetition & achievements (4,6)  

Pick whichever phases match your schedule - the code base is already modular, so each enhancement is self-contained.

Happy teaching!
